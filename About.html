        </div>

        <h3>My name is Abilena Thomas! I live in a very small, rural town in Mid-Missouri. I have two cats, Anduin and Buttons, as well as several chickens.</h3>
        <h3>For the past 6 years, I've been working in Veterinary Medicine as a veterinary technician. I really enjoyed what I did, but burn out was beginning to hit me hard.</h3>
        <h3>I'm interested in starting a new career that will allow me to spend more time with my family and allow me to work on obtaining my goals for the future.</h3>
