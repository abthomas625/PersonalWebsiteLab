        <p>I got married over the weekend! It was a very nice time. I enjoyed lots of food and was able to visit with a lot of people that I hadn't seen in years.</p>
        <h2>Developing</h2>
        <p>
            Just starting out has been tough. This is a serious change from what I have been doing. For the first time in a long time, I'm excited for what the future holds.

        <h2>Hometown</h2>
        <p>There's not much to say about my hometown. 
            We have no stoplights, and there's only one good place to eat. 
            It would honestly be a quaint little town if there was effort into cleaning it up.</p>
